# robofleet_base_client
A barebones robofleet client with no ROS dependency

This stripped-down version of robofleet client has no dependency on ROS on the client system, and depends on the QT websocket library.
It additionally does not include any in-built configuration scheme.

This repository is meant to serve as a template for a more complex robofleet client to be built on top of it for systems that cannot support ROS.
